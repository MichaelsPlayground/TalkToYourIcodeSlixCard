## How to buy them ?

If you are going to buy these tags just have a look at the offer by **shopNfc**: 
https://www.shopnfc.com/en/nfc-stickers/478-nfc-stickers-icode-slix-50x50mm.html

They cost about 7 Euro per 10 piece (minimum quantity of 10 pieces) and it's a free
delivery around the world.

# The following description is from an old project !

## project / app status

At the moment the  app is just a stub with no real functions as it is a 1:1 copy 
of the "Talk to your Mifare DESFire EV1/EV2/EV3" project.

The app description is copied as well so please do not rely on any wording or code 
in this repo so far !


Original description follows:

For simplicity this app uses a DESFire tag with **factory settings** means:

- it uses **Plain communication** only (no MACed or Enciphered Communication)
- it shows how to work with **Standard Files** only (no Backup, Value, Linear Record, Cyclic Record or TransactionMAC Files)
- there are 2 **Access modes** hardcoded: **Free Access** (use without any key) and **Key Secured Access** with 5 predefined keys
  (0 = Application Master Key, 1 = Read & Write access key, 2 = Change Access Rights key, 3 = Read access key and 4 = Write access key)
- it works with a predefined **Application Identifier** (AID) of "D1D2D3"
- the  Standard files have a hardcoded size of 32 bytes
- the app is working with **DES keys** only and the **Master Application KEY** and it's **Key Settings** remain unchanged to prevent from any damage to the card

As the **Authentication** with a key is essentially for a successful transaction there is a huge amount of code lines taken from another 
project. I copied all necessary code from the **NFCJLIB project** available here: https://github.com/andrade/nfcjlib which is provided 
by **Daniel Andrade**, thanks a lot for his contribution. Please obey the LICENCE here: https://github.com/andrade/nfcjlib/blob/master/LICENSE.

The only 'official' information's on DESFire EVx cards can be found here (yes, you understand it right - 'official' and useful 
documentation is available only on another card type, the DESFire Light tag):

Type of messaging:
- plain communication
- MACed communication
- fully enciphered communication using DES, TDES or AES keys
- AES Secure Messaging
- LRP Secure Messaging (Leakage Resilient Primitive)

This app always uses ISO/IEC 7816-4 wrapped comands.

However, I can provide you with the following information about the "SET CONFIGURATION" command:

The command is used to configure the settings of a Mifare DESFire EV3 card.
The command has the following format:
SET CONFIGURATION <option> <value>
The <option> field specifies the setting to be configured.
The <value> field specifies the value for the setting.
The following table lists the possible options for the <option> field:

Option	Description
01	Enable or disable the transaction timer.
02	Set the value of the transaction timer.
03	Enable or disable the access control feature.
04	Set the value of the access control key.


The value for enabling the transaction timer is 0x01. The value for disabling the transaction timer is 0x00.

enable: private static final byte[] SET_CONFIGURATION_COMMAND = {0x00, 0x03, 0x01, 0x01};
disable: private static final byte[] SET_CONFIGURATION_COMMAND = {0x00, 0x03, 0x01, 0x00};

     * Note: to run LRP tasks the PICC has to be in LRP mode. You can find code for this mode
     * in Mifare DESFire Light Features and Hints AN12343.pdf pages 43 + 44
     * This is an IRREVERSIBLE action and PERMANENTLY disables AES secure messaging, meaning
     * LRP secure messaging is required to be used for all future sessions.
